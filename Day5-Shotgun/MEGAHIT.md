MEGAHIT is a _de novo_ assembler first introduced in 2015 which has been continually updated since then. It utilizes mutliple k-mer sizes when building a de Bruijn graph 
along with a strategy to rescue low-coverage regions while attempting to account for sequencing error.

From [the MEGAHIT publication](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/10/1674/177884):

## Installation and setup

### File directory setup and data acquisition 
Let's make a top-level directory for our analysis, the sub-directories, and download the data as usual:
```
cd ~
mkdir MEGAHIT_analysis
cd MEGAHIT_analysis
mkdir data scripts output
cd data
wget -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Penn-State-Microbiome-Center/KickStart-Workshop-2022/main/Day5-Shotgun/Data/file_list.txt
ls *.gz | xargs -P6 -I{} gunzip {}
cd ..
```


MEGAHIT is already installed in the OnDemand environment, and you can activate it via:
```
module use /gpfs/group/RISE/sw7/modules
module load anaconda
conda activate microbiome1
```

Otherwise, if you are on a different system, MEGAHIT can be installed with conda in the following fashion:
```
conda create -y -n megahit -c bioconda megahit
conda activate megahit
```

## Usage
There are a variety of parameters that can be specified with MEGAHIT:
```

                                            meta-large: '--k-min 27 --k-max 127 --k-step 10'

Other Arguments:
    --continue                              continue a MEGAHIT run from its last available check point.
                                            please set the output directory correctly when using this option.

    -v/--version                            print version
```
However, the main ones we will be concerned with are specifying if the input data (which must be `fasta` or `fastq`) is paired end (`-1` and `-2` flags), interleaved (`-12` flag) 
or `-r` single-end, as well as the specification of the output directory with `-o`.

### Running MEGAHIT

To run MEGAHIT using the default parameters on one of the samples we have, all it takes is the following:
```
megahit -r data/SRS014464-Anterior_nares.fasta -o output/default
```

Before we investigate the output of MEGAHIT, let's run it with a few different parameter settings.

We could specify that _all_ k-mers should be considered, and can indicate this by setting the minimum k-mer count to 1:
```
megahit -r data/SRS014464-Anterior_nares.fasta -o output/min1 --min-count 1
```
This will likely result in many more, shorter contigs due to trusting _every_ k-mer as a true k-mer. I.e. Since we have ignored the effect of noise, we will likely 
have a variety of contigs that only differ by a few bases, which are likely due to sequencing error.

Alternatively, we could also change what range of k-mer sizes we want to use. In general, the larger the k-mer size you use, the more specific (and less sensitive) your assemblies will be. 
In practice, this _can_ result in the assembly of high abundance organisms. Inversely, the smaller the k-mer size, the more sensitive (but less specific) your assembly will be. 
I.e. you may get a bunch of really short contigs.

```
megahit -r data/SRS014464-Anterior_nares.fasta -o output/ksize15-51-10 --k-min 15 --k-max 51 --k-step 10
```

## Analyzing the assembly

Now that we've assembled one of these samples, let's go ahead and run some basic statistics on it. [QUAST](http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quast) is the premier genomic and metagenomic 
assembly assessment package. If you provide it a reference, it can can provide you quite a bit of insightful information as to the quality of your assembly. Even without 
a reference though, you can still use it to gain some insight into your assembly.

### Installing QUAST

QUAST comes pre-installed in the OnDemand system and can be activated via:
```bash
conda deactivate
module use /gpfs/group/RISE/sw7/modules
module load anaconda
conda activate microbiome2
```

If you are on a different system, to install QUAST, we simply need to run:
```
conda deactivate
conda create --prefix ~/quast -y -c bioconda quast bwa bedtools
conda activate ~/quast
```

### Running QUAST
There are a number of different ways to run QUAST, but since we are doing _de novo_ metagenome assembly, we do not have a reference to compare to. As such, we can just run QUAST 
to get some insight about the basic assembly quality.

MEGAHIT returns a main `final.contigs.fa` in the output directory which contains the assembled contigs. As such, we can run quast on a single assembly in the following way:
```
quast -o output/default/quast_out `#<<-- specify the output folder` \
 -m 250 `#<<-- consider 250bp+ as a contig` \
 --circos `#<<-- make a circos plot` \
 --glimmer `#<<-- use glimmer to predict genes (note: you should use -mgm (MetaGeneMark) instead, but we would need everyone to agree to a license and download it, so we aren't doing that here` \
 --rna-finding `#<<-- try to find ribosomal RNA genes` \
 --single data/SRS014464-Anterior_nares.fasta `#<-- tell QUAST where the reads were so you can map it back to the assembly` \
  output/default/final.contigs.fa `#<<-- the input assembly`
 
```
Note: running this in a single line without the comments looks like:
```
quast -o output/default/quast_out -m 250 --circos --glimmer --rna-finding --single data/SRS014464-Anterior_nares.fasta output/default/final.contigs.fa
```

If you download the QUAST report, you can view it in a browser by clicking the `report.html` tag. It should look something like this:
![quast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6362936/128277768-bb09a609-6a67-4997-8812-12202d19ec19.PNG)


Let's go ahead and run QUAST on each of the assemblies. We will create a file that will automatically create a QUAST report for each of the assemblies.
```
touch scripts/run_quast.sh
chmod +x scripts/run_quast.sh
nano scripts/run_quast.sh  #<<-- or vim or the like
```
Then paste the following into that file:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e  # exit if there is an error
set -u  # exit if a variable is undefined

scriptFolder=`dirname $0`  #<<-- where this script is located
baseFolder=$(dirname $scriptFolder)  #<<-- the main analysis folder (one up from the script folder)
outputFolder="${baseFolder}/output"  #<<-- output folder
dataFolder="${baseFolder}/data"  #<<-- input folder

# Now analyze everything in one go
for folder in `ls -d ${outputFolder}/*`;
do
        quast -o ${folder}/quast_out -m 250 --circos --glimmer --rna-finding --single ${dataFolder}/SRS014464-Anterior_nares.fasta ${folder}/final.contigs.fa
done

```
Then run it:
```
./scripts/run_quast.sh
```

Now that we have run all the analyses, let's compare their results by downloading the associated output folders and viewing the html output.
**Can you tell which of the assemblies was the best from viewing the reports?**

**In which situations would the different MEGAHIT parameter settings be useful?**
