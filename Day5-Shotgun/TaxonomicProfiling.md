# Taxonomic profiling

In this part of the tutorial, we will cover taxonomic profiling with the following tools:
1. [MetaPhlAn3](TaxonomicProfiling-MetaPhlAn3.md)
2. [mOTUs2](TaxonomicProfiling-mOTUs2.md)

We will cover the basic usages of these tools, explore some visualizations, and compare the results of these two different tools.

First, though, I will run through a brief reminder about what taxonomic profiling is and how various tools "do their thing."

# Please go to the [MetaPhlAn3](TaxonomicProfiling-MetaPhlAn3.md) section
